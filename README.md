## Building
Dolphin is a regular Go program using Go modules, so build it how you would any normal Go application.

## Installation
Create a Discord bot [here](https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/me). Next, add the bot to your Discord server using this link, replacing the Client ID with your bot's ID:
```
https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=<CLIENT_ID>&scope=bot
```

In your Minecraft server.properties, set the following options and restart the server:
```
enable-rcon=true
rcon.password=<password>
rcon.port=<1-65535>
```

Place the downloaded or built binary where ever you want, and run it to generate the config. By default, the config is generated and looked for in `$HOME/.config/dolphin/dolphin.conf`. You can override this using the program's command flags.

## Usage
```
./dolphin [OPTIONS]
```
Options:
```
-c, --config - The path to the configuration file to use
    --debug  - Print additional debug lines to stdout
-h, --help   - Print the help message
```
